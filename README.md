A portfolio website is a space online that showcases your work, skills, and experiences. It can be a great way to share your work with potential employers, collaborators, or the press. You can use a portfolio website when applying for jobs or internships. 
Make it easy to navigate
Prioritize simplicity so your site is visually appealing and easy to navigate. 
 
Use a consistent design
Use a consistent design, color scheme, and domain to enhance your personal brand. 
 
Add client testimonials
Build credibility by adding client testimonials and integrating social media. 
 
Include a call to action
Provide various ways for clients to contact you, such as an email address or a contact form. 
 
Add a personal touch
Include a few personal details on your "About Me" page to make it more memorable. 
 
Consider the design
A bad design can make you look incompetent, so it might be better to have no portfolio website than one that looks bad.
